# cbenz home directory

Scripts and config files from my home directory.

This is my own stuff, scripts I wrote but which are not strictly private so I publish by default before someone asks :-)

Make symlinks like this:

    ln -s /path/to/home-directory/bin/<script_name> ~/.local/bin # (or ~/bin)
